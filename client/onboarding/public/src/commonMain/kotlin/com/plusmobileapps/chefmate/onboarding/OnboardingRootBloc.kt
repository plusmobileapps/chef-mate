/**
 * Navigation BLoC that drives the first-run onboarding flow. It owns a Decompose router that walks
 * the user from the [WelcomeBloc] through a series of feature tours ([ShareRecipesBloc],
 * [SaveRecipesBloc], [AddToGroceryBloc], [MealPlanningBloc], [CookModeBloc], [RecipeBooksBloc],
 * [GroceryListsBloc]) to the final [StartCookingBloc]. When the user finishes (or skips), it marks
 * onboarding as completed and emits [Output.Finished] so the root can load the rest of the app.
 *
 * From the welcome screen the user can also choose to sign in; that is surfaced as [Output.SignIn]
 * so the root can open the authentication flow. From the final [StartCookingBloc] step, the user
 * can also choose to sign up for an account, surfaced as [Output.SignUp].
 *
 * The flow can also be re-entered from within the app (e.g. Settings → replay onboarding). In that
 * case [Props.isDismissible] is true, so the first step shows a back arrow that exits the flow
 * ([Output.Dismissed]) instead of hiding it, and [Props.isSignedIn] can be true so an already
 * signed-in user isn't offered a sign-in or sign-up they can't use.
