# Chef Mate

An app that is your mate in the kitchen managing the grocery list and keeping recipes to help you cook.

## Getting Started

This is a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/get-started.html) project targeting Android, iOS, Web, Desktop (JVM), Server. It aims to share as much code as possible in a modular way, so the general file structure of the project is as follows: 

* [client](./client/) - all the shared client code and client application code
  * [composeApp](./client/composeApp/) - the compose multiplatform applications
  * [database](./client/database/) - client database
  * [root](./client/root/) - root BLoC (business logic component) to manage navigation of the whole app
  * [grocery](./client/grocery/) - list and detail BLoCs for groceries
  * [shared](./client/shared/) - common client code
  * [testing](./client/testing/) - common testing helpers
* [server](./server/) - backend code
* [build-logic](./build-logic/) - all the convention plugins to share logic of modular libraries

### Android

```shell
./gradlew :client:composeApp:installDebug
```

### Desktop (JVM)

```shell
./gradlew :client:composeApp:installDebug
```

### iOS

To build and run the development version of the iOS app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDEâ€™s toolbar or open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.


### Server

```shell
./gradlew :server:run
```
